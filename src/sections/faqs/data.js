      question: "How do I handle conflict in team project?",
      answer: " I have never experience a serious conflict so far other than a minor time management problem within the team. My approach was to make sure I listen the problem first and understand what is causing the delay. Then I make sure all the team members work together to solve the issue and continue. I would use the same approach for any possible conflicts within a team in any collabarotive work in the future, as I believe listening and communicating is the key to solving problems."
